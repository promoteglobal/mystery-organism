# mystery-organism
Creates an object of mock up strands DNA that consists of 15 parts each with it's own specimen number.  There are different methods that it returns. Mutate() mutate returns an dna strand with one mutated dna.  CompareDna() compares current specimen with passed in specimen and prints what percent they have in common. willLikelySurvive() willreturn true if the DnA is at least 60% C or G.  This means the specimen will be likely to survive if true and thirtyInstances() is a seperate function that will collect enough samples and return an array of 30 likely to survive specimens. 

## How to use:
Clone to to your machine. Run in the console or if you have node installed, you can type `node main.js` and see the results in the terminal.  I have a helper function on the last line that proves all specimens are likely to survive.

## Challenges and credits
This was a practice project from the full stack program at Codeacademy. I wrote all of the main.js file, there was only one page. The only thing given to me were the returnRandBase() and mockUpStrand()functions at the top of the page and general hints on how to build it.
